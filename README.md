*A Study of Different Machine Learning Algorithms for State of Charge (SoC) Estimation in Lithium-ion Battery Pack*

### Abstract
Forecasting the state of charge (SoC) using battery control systems is challenging due to the non-linear degradation of lithium-ion batteries. Accurate SoC estimation is critical to ensuring the safety, efficiency, and longevity of batteries. This paper evaluates six supervised learning algorithms—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Extra Trees Regressor, XGBoost, and Decision Trees—for SoC estimation. Traditional methods like open circuit voltage (OCV), Coulomb counting (CC), and Kalman filter (KF) are also discussed and compared to contemporary machine learning approaches. The study identifies machine learning as a promising tool for improving SoC estimation, providing better adaptability, accuracy, and real-time performance.

### III. Traditional SoC Estimation Methods
#### A. Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) Method
This method calculates SoC using voltage measurements under open-circuit conditions. While simple, it is prone to inaccuracies due to temperature dependence and the need for steady-state conditions.

#### B. Coulomb Counting (CC) Method
CC integrates current over time to estimate SoC. It suffers from cumulative error accumulation and lacks a feedback mechanism.

#### C. Kalman Filter (KF)
The KF provides a closed-loop approach, combining model-based predictions with real-time measurements. It is computationally expensive but offers better accuracy compared to OCV and CC methods.

#### A. Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It performs well with high-dimensional data.

#### B. Decision Tree Regressor
This algorithm builds sequential decision trees to estimate SoC. It is simple but may overfit with complex data.

#### C. Extra Trees Regressor
An extension of Random Forest, Extra Trees introduces additional randomness in feature selection and splitting thresholds.

#### D. XGBoost
XGBoost employs gradient boosting and is highly efficient in terms of computation and accuracy.

#### E. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
GBM iteratively improves prediction accuracy by minimizing loss functions. It is versatile but computationally intensive.
